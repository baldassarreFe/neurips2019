This page lists some useful resources which you can use for the challenge.

### Reproducible Code

- If you are working in PyTorch, we strongly recommend using [Pytorch Lightning](https://github.com/williamFalcon/pytorch-lightning), a framework which takes care of the boilerplate and provides highly reproducible standards of ML research pipeline. Check the [seed project](https://github.com/williamFalcon/pytorch-lightning-conference-seed) as a good starting point.
- Document your code appropriately
- Have a `README.md` file which describes the exact steps to run your code

### Compute Resources

- [CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com/) provides 10hrs/month of GPU accelerated platform free to academics. [CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com/) also is our Cloud Platform Sponsor, so they will be providing limited teams more compute resources than the free tier. Check [Registration](/neurips2019/registration/) for more details.
- Instructors can apply for [Google Cloud credits](https://cloud.google.com/edu/) for their students. Each student will be given a small number of credits to start (approx. $50).
- By default, Google Cloud accounts don't come with a GPU quota, but you can find instructions on how to request GPUs, including links on how to check and increase quotas, [at this link](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus/add-gpus).
- If necessary, instructors can ask for much more computing credits (up to $1000 per student) by contacting: [CloudEDUGrants@google.com](mailto:CloudEDUGrants@google.com).
- Students can also request a $300 credit from Google Compute Cloud.
- Anyone can use [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) which provides free GPU backed Jupyter Notebooks
- If you are another company that can offer cloud computing credits, please contact [reproducibility.challenge@gmail.com](mailto:reproducibility.challenge@gmail.com) or [koustuv.sinha@mail.mcgill.ca](mailto:koustuv.sinha@mail.mcgill.ca).
